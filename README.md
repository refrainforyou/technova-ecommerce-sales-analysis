# Data Model

The dataset follows a **star schema** structure.

### Fact Tables
- `fact_orders`
- `fact_order_items`
- `fact_returns`

### Dimension Tables
- `dim_customers`
- `dim_products`
- `dim_categories`
- `dim_subcategories`
- `dim_calendar`

This structure allows efficient analytical queries and dashboard performance.

# SQL Analysis

SQL was used to:

- calculate revenue and profit metrics
- analyze sales by product and category
- calculate order metrics
- identify top performing products

Example query:

```sql
SELECT SUM(total_order_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM (
    SELECT
        fo.order_id,
        SUM(dp.price * fi.quantity) * (1 - fo.discount_amount)
        + fo.shipping_amount AS total_order_amount
    FROM fact_orders fo
    JOIN fact_order_items fi ON fo.order_id = fi.order_id
    JOIN dim_products dp ON fi.product_id = dp.product_id
    WHERE fo.order_status = 'Completed'
    GROUP BY fo.order_id, fo.discount_amount, fo.shipping_amount
) t;
```
